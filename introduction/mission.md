# Mission & Vision

## Our Mission

**To democratize institutional-grade derivatives trading through autonomous AI agents, making sophisticated financial strategies accessible to everyone.**

## Our Vision

We envision a future where:

### 1. **Trading Intelligence is Universal**
Every individual, regardless of financial literacy, can access professional-grade trading strategies through conversational AI interfaces.

### 2. **Capital Efficiency Meets Simplicity**
Complex derivatives strategies like straddles, spreads, and hedging are abstracted into simple, one-click actions.

### 3. **Non-Custodial by Default**
Users maintain sovereignty over their assets while benefiting from automated, intelligent execution.

### 4. **Community-Driven Innovation**
The protocol evolves through DAO governance, with strategy improvements proposed and voted on by $BETH holders.

## Core Principles
