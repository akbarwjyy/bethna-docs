## Staking Mechanics

### Lock Period

- **No lock period**: Unstake anytime
- **Instant tier downgrade**: When you unstake, you immediately lose tier benefits

### Rewards

While staked, you earn:
- **Fee Discounts**: Immediate savings on every trade
- **Governance Rights**: Vote on proposals
- **Potential Appreciation**: Benefit from buyback & burn

### No IL Risk

Unlike LP staking, $BETH staking has **zero impermanent loss risk**. You're only exposed to $BETH price volatility.

## ROI Calculator

### Example: Silver Tier

**Assumptions**:
- Stake: 50,000 $BETH ($5,000 at $0.10)
- Monthly profit: $5,000
- Fee savings: 8% (20% → 12%)

**Monthly Savings**: $5,000 × 8% = **$400**

**Months to ROI**: $5,000 / $400 = **12.5 months**

**After 1 year**: $400 × 12 = **$4,800 saved**

Plus: $BETH price appreciation if protocol grows.

### Example: Gold Tier

**Assumptions**:
- Stake: 100,000 $BETH ($10,000)
- Monthly profit: $10,000
- Fee savings: 10%

**Monthly Savings**: $10,000 × 10% = **$1,000**

**Months to ROI**: $10,000 / $1,000 = **10 months**

## Dynamic Tier Adjustments (Phase 2)

In Phase 2, we'll introduce **dynamic tiers** based on:

1. **Trading Volume**: High-volume traders get bonus discounts
2. **Win Rate**: Consistently profitable users get priority features
3. **Community Contribution**: Forum participation, bug reports rewarded

**Example**:
- Silver Tier + High Volume = 10% fee (Gold equivalent)
- Gold Tier + High Win Rate = Agent Delta early access
