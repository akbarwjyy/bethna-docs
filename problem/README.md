# The Problem Space

## Overview

While Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has matured significantly, the **Derivatives** sector remains inaccessible to 99% of users.

## The Core Challenges

### 1. Cognitive Overload

Understanding options trading requires mastery of complex concepts:

| Term | Complexity | Barrier |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Delta** | How much the option price moves with the underlying | High |
| **Theta** | Time decay—options lose value as expiry approaches | High |
| **Implied Volatility** | Market's expectation of future price swings | Very High |
| **Strike Selection** | Choosing the right price point | Critical |
| **Expiry Management** | Timing your trades correctly | Critical |

Most retail users give up before executing their first trade.

### 2. Execution Risk

Manual trading on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) exposes users to:

- **High Slippage**: Price moves between quote and execution
- **Front-Running**: MEV bots detect and exploit pending transactions
- **Failed Transactions**: Complex multi-step swaps that revert
- **Gas Waste**: Paying for failed transactions

### 3. Time Intensity

Optimal options strategies require **24/7 monitoring**:

- Greeks change continuously as price and time evolve
- Profit opportunities may last only minutes
- Risk exposure shifts throughout the day
- Manual monitoring is humanly impossible

### 4. Capital Inefficiency

Without proper tools, users often:
- Over-hedge, reducing potential returns
- Under-hedge, exposing themselves to liquidation
- Miss rebalancing opportunities
- Hold positions past optimal exit points

## Market Statistics

{% hint style="warning" %}
**The DeFi Derivatives Gap**
- **$10B+** Total Value Locked in DeFi
- **<1%** of users actively trade derivatives
- **85%** of retail options traders lose money (lack of strategy)
- **60%** give up after 1-2 failed trades
{% endhint %}

## The Institutional Advantage

Traditional finance (TradFi) institutions have:
- Dedicated options desks with PhDs
- Algorithmic trading systems
- Real-time risk management tools
- 24/7 monitoring infrastructure

**Retail users have none of this—until now.**
